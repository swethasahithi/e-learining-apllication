  <li class="news-green"><h3 class="news-head">Women Applicants Increase under PMAY</h3><p>In a good news to women home buyers across the country, it has been found that a number of banks are offering special interest rates in an effort to encourage more and more women to purchase homes. It is mandatory under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) for the property to be registered in the name of a female owner. There has been a 6% rise in the number of women home loan applicants under PMAY.</p> <p>Not just this, to offer more support to women, an extra stamp duty concession is also being given to women if the property is registered under a female name. Many well-known banks are offering special interest rates exclusively for women. On the whole, a woman who is applying for a loan can get a discount in interest rate of up to 0.05% per annum when compared to men.</p> <p>Banks such as SBI, HDFC and SBI offer special home loan interest rates for women. As far as PMAY is concerned, the total subsidy that can be claimed adds up to Rs.2.67 lakh. Under the PMAY scheme, the aim is to encourage women to own property and this, in turn, will help them become more empowered. Subsidies will be provided under this scheme for all home loan applications made by women borrowers.</p>
