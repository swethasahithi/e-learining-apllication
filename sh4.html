<p>The Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation has enlisted the help of some leading banks in the country to provide loans for construction under PMAY. The banks offer loans at a comparatively lower rate as government pays the rest on behalf of the applicant. This model of subsidized loans help more economically weaker people to build a house.</p>
<p>HDFC Bank has partnered with the government to offer loans to people who have applied for PMAY scheme. Here’s what is looks like:</p>

<ul>
<li>The applicant’s family must not own a house in any part of the country.</li>
<li>In the case of a married couple, either a single or a joint ownership deal is allowed, and both options will receive just one subsidy.</li>
<li>The applicant’s family must not have availed the benefit of any housing-related schemes set up by the Government of India.</li>
</ul>


<p>PMAY, while being a populist scheme, is also a progressive one as it helps millions of urban poor in the country own a house they can call their own. This scheme, upon completion, will serve as a great model for other developing countries to follow.</p>
